# Introduction

This is a repository that works as a starter for a full stack mobile application and includes a Back Office Web App.

## Main technologies:

- react-native (mobile application);
- react + vite (Back Office SPA);
- typescript;
- supabase (Database + Serverless Backend);
- bitbucket pipelines;

## Requirements:

- NodeJs@18 (it is recommend you to use [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started), read below);
- Docker;
- iOS and Android as mentioned [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&os=macos&platform=android) (chose your Development OS and Target OS accordingly to your case);

### Volta

With Volta, you can select a Node engine once and then stop worrying about it. You can switch between projects and stop having to manually switch between Nodes. You can install npm package binaries in your toolchain without having to periodically reinstall them or figure out why theyâ€™ve stopped working.

All projects here are pinned to a specific node version. This is important to make sure all developers are working with same version. If you use volta the version will configured correctly when you change to project folder.

## Main features included:

- Basic Authentication features:
  - Sign up email / password (Mobile App);
  - Sign in email / password (Mobile App);
  - Recover password process (Mobile App and Back office);
  - Authentication, using oauth github provider or oauth google provider (Mobile App);
  - Logout (Mobile App and Back office);
  - Update user account (Mobile App);
- Initial Back office automatically generated from supabase database schema (customizations may be needed for each case);
- Possibility to generate custom pages using a rich text editor (wysiwyg) that stores the corresponding html in the database (Back office);
- "Terms and conditions" an "Privacy policy" screens using Back office feature mentioned in previous point. Content for those screens should be configured using Back office. (Mobile App);
- Core pipelines (customizations will be needed for each project);

## Goals

The goal for this project is to supply some recipes with code that is usually repeated from project to project, optimizing Mobiweb processes to start new products for our clients.

With this, we aim to stand out in a competitive market, while keeping our quality high and our clients happy.

## Repository structure

This repository is composed by 3 main folders/projects:

- supabase: configurations needed for supabase database and integration with our applications;
- RNMobileApp: mobile application using bare react-native;
- BackofficeCMS: Single Page Application (web) for an auto generated Back office from supabase database, offering the possibility for **Admins** to change some data directly;

Besides those 3 components, there is a big a core build around pipelines defined in this repository, using bitbucket pipelines (bitbucket-pipelines.yml). Those pipelines will be described in details in a later section.

## Getting Started - TLDR

**If you are a beginner on the technologies mentioned above, do not skip the next sections. It is recommended that you first read "Detailed Overview" section and then go back here.**

This section is a quick overview of the steps needed to start working with this repository, a base knowledge on the technologies mentioned is assumed:

### Fork this repository to your own project

Follow bitbucket instructions to fork the repository and clone it to your machine, open a terminal in the root of your repository.

### Supabase integrations

Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and **create your supabase remote project**. If you, for now, want to use it locally only, skip this section and read **"Detailed Overview"** section.

**Note: Do not forget the database password defined while creating the project, it will be needed. And make sure you store it safely.**

Access your keys at **Project Settings -> API**:

- Project URL;
- Anon key at Project API Keys;

Go to **supabase** folder:

```sh
cd supabase
```

Create a **.env** file with same content as **.env.example** and update it with keys accessed previously.

Configure Mobile project and Back Office project with configs defined at **.env** by executing:

```sh
yarn supabase-configs
```

This command will configure **supabase.configs.ts** files needed in both projects to integrate with supabase.

Now link your remote supabase project with your repository by doing:

```sh
npx supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

Replace <project-id> with correct value. It can be found at **Project Settings -> API**.

More information about it could be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project). If you are not logged in to supabase you need to do it by executing:

```sh
npx supabase login
```

Andd following the instructions.

Now execute:

```sh
npx supabase db push
```

It will update your remote database with **supabase/migrations**. After that you should be able to check database changes on remote project by going to its dashboard.

Your serverless database is now configured and ready to be used.

If you change your database directly on your supabase remote project using the Supabase dashboard you need to pull those changes, locally, to have the migrations updated on code and syncronise your local database:

```sh
npx supabase db pull
```

You should now find a new migration files at **supabase/migrations**. After that execute:

```sh
npx supabase db reset
```

To update you local database with last changes.

**Note: To execute some of those commands you will need to have Docker running on your machine and have executed _npx supabase start command_ to start local environment. More information about it at "Detailed Overview" section.**

#### Auth providers

To have github and google authentication working you need to configure your supabase project with needed configurations at **Authentication -> Providers** and configure **Authentication -> URL Configuration** correctly. More information about it at **"Github or Google Authentication"** and **"Deep Linking"** section.

### Mobile application

Go to **RNMobileApp** project and execute

```sh
yarn start
```

Or follow instructions at **RNMobileApp/README.md**.

### Back Office Single Page Application

Go to **RNMobileApp** project and execute

```sh
yarn dev
```

And open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### Pipelines

You may not want to use the default pipelines here. If that is the case remove **bitbucket-pipelines.yml** or adapt steps as you need. Below there is a **Pipelines and deployment** section explaining it in detail.

# Detailed Overview

## Supabase

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. Start your project with a Postgres database, Authentication, instant APIs, Edge Functions, Realtime subscriptions, Storage, and Vector embeddings.

### Local development

The following content is based on the official guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development).

Make sure you have Docker installed and running. Sometimes you may have some conflicts between old containers or images and need to stop some containers and/or remove images.

**Only execute those command if you are sure that you can eliminate all containers and/or images. Probably we do not need to use both commands, or you only need the first**.

```sh
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

```sh
docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)
```

If you need to remove all volumes run (this will remove all database/data storages inside docker):

```sh
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q --filter dangling=true)
```

Go to **supabse** folder and execute:

```sh
npx supabase start
```

This will take some time and will start useful tools, namely:

- Supabase Studio at [https://localhost:54323](https://localhost:54323), the same as Supabase Dashboard in the cloud;
- Inbucket application at [https://localhost:54324](https://localhost:54324). In local environment supabase will not sends emails, but they will be available at this application for you to test it locally;

Needed keys and database access are shared when the starting process is done.

For local development you want to create a **.env** file with supabase variables needed to integrate your mobile and back office application with your local supabase environment by using:

```sh
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
SUPBASE_API_KEY=ANON_KEY_SUPPLIED_IN_THE_END_OF_START_PROCESS_HERE
```

Now run

```sh
yarn supabase-configs
```

And both applications will be configured to use local supabase. For more details read **supabase/README.md**.

### Database

Now that you have a postgres database running locally, we need to execute initial sql to have initial tables and functions.

#### Database Migrations

To start you have some migrations at **migrations** folder.

The first migration **migrations/\*\_user_auth_management_starter.sql** is the structure needed for authentication. You may want to update columns for **profiles** table according to your project requirements.

Then we have two migrations that create two functions:

- get_all_table_name (**migrations/\*\_list_tables_function.sql**);
- get_types (**migrations/\*\_get_table_types.sql**);

To be used at Back office web app to auto generate needed pages for each table existing in **public** database schema.

For **Custom page** feature you can find the following migrations to create **custom_pages** table, preparing specific data for "Terms and conditions" and "Privacy policy" cases, and configure needed policies:

- **20230918092251_add_custom_pages_table.sql**;
- **20230918092742_add_initial_custom_pages_rows.sql**;
- **20230918105318_custom_pages_policies.sql**;

To apply those migrations on your local supabase database execute:

```sh
npx supabase db reset
```

After this command is executed with success you can go to [Dashboard Studio](https://localhost:54323) and at **Database** check the new tables, functions, triggers and storage.

You could also create your tables directly from [Dashboard Studio](https://localhost:54323) following the intuitive UI it offers. However, if you do that do not forget to follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#diffing-changes) to have your migrations generated as code. This is important to have syncronized with other members of the team and in cases you need to bootstrap everything again or migrate to different environments.

Now your local database is configured and ready to be used.

##### Create migrations

To create a new migration, locally, you need to execute:

```sh
npx supabase migration new migration_name
```

A new file at **supabase/migrations** will be created for you to fill it with desired sql code.

After that you should execute:

```sh
npx supabase db reset
```

You can find documentation about migration commands [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-migration-new).

#### Syncronize with remote supabase project

In case you already have a remote supabase project you should link it with your repository by doing:

```sh
npx supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

Replace <project-id> with correct value. It can be found at **Project Settings -> API**.

More information about it could be found [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project).

**Note:** If you are not, you first need to be authenticated to supabase cloud through the terminal by executing the following command and following the instructions:

```sh
npx supabase login
```

And then execute:

```sh
npx supabase db push
```

It will update your remote database with **supabase/migrations**. After that you should be able to check database changes on remote project by going to its dashboard.

In the opposite direction, to update you local database with changes from remote project. You also need to _pull_ those changes to remote project, if you have it, using:

```sh
npx supabase db pull
```

### Supabase security

Security is very important and should ensure that no bad actor has access to our information in any way.

We should never forget that protecting our systems on frontend is never enough. **It must always be protected on backend and database layers as well**.

For that supabase and postgres offer **[Row lever security](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)** and **[Policies](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-policies)** features that allow us to configure who is able to access our data at database layer.

Initial this project is configured to have a **roles** system. At **supabase/migrations/20230918101007_add_profile_roles** you can find a migration that adds to **profiles** table a **roles** column, which is an array of strings.

The current code assumes the existence of one role: **ADMIN**. This role is used for Back office users.

At **supabase/migrations/20230918103312_check_permissions_function** you will find the creation of a function called **check_user_permission** that could be used at policies to restrict database operations according to user roles.

You can find an example of its usage at **supabase/migrations/20230918105318_custom_pages_policies** where custom pages are public for read but only an ADMIN user can insert or update a custom page:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "public read access for custom_pages"
ON public.custom_pages
FOR SELECT USING (
  true
);

CREATE POLICY "insert only for ADMIN users for custom_pages"
ON public.custom_pages
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated WITH CHECK (check_user_permission(auth.uid(), array['ADMIN']));

CREATE POLICY "update only for ADMIN users for custom_pages"
ON public.custom_pages
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated USING (check_user_permission(auth.uid(), array['ADMIN'])) WITH CHECK (check_user_permission(auth.uid(), array['ADMIN']));
```

For more details about this implementation we recommend you to read this article [here](https://medium.com/@jimmyruann/row-level-security-custom-permission-base-authorization-with-supabase-91389e6fc48c).

You will also find configuration to only allow ADMIN users to update roles, to avoid having anyone to be able to change their roles to ADMIN. For this case a trick suggest [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71167428) was used.

You find more about policies [here](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-policies).

## Deep Linking

For authentication process to work well on mobile, deep linking was implemented for the following features:

- Reset password (email link redirect to mw://recoverpassword);
- Github sign in (after github authentication, user is redirected to mw://signin/github);
- Email confirmation after signup (confirmation email link redirect to mw://signup);
- Google sign in using web oauth (after google authentication, user is redirected to mw://signin/google);

For that **mw** scheme was defined for the application (below follow instructions to change the scheme for your application);

For the redirects to work well you need to go to your supabase remote project at **Authentication -> URL Configuration -> Redirect URLs** and add:

- mw://recoverpassword;
- mw://signin/github;
- mw://signup;
- mw://signin/google;

Anytime you have any different **redirect URL** related with supabase authentication you need to add it here. The same for needed URLs related with Back office.

**Note:** If you change the **scheme** of your application, update the URLs accordingly.

More about deep linking [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/). You should not need to do any extra configuration than what is already done in this repository.

### Change scheme application

You should update the **scheme** of your application, instead of using **mw**. For that you need to do the following:

**Android**:
Look for **android:scheme="mw"** at **android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** and change **mw** to your scheme;

**iOS**:
Look for **CFBundleURLSchemes** at **ios/RNMobileApp/Info.plist** and change **mw** to your scheme;

On **RNMobileApp** project look for all references to **mw://** and change it accordingly.

## Github or Google Authentication

For github authentication to work you need to create a github application and configure it at **Authentication -> Providers -> Github** on your supabase remote project dashboard.

Follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github#create-a-github-oauth-app).

For google authentication you need to create a OAuth Client Id and configure **Authentication -> Providers -> Google** on your supabase remote project dashboard.

**Note:** This example is not using Android Native sign in, but web oauth.

Follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google#configuration-web).

In mobile for the authentication to work some more work is required since we need to show the provider authentication page as in this example for github (screens/Auth/Auth.tsx):

```tsx
import * as WebBrowser from "expo-web-browser";

const { error, data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: "github" /* "google" */,
  options: {
    redirectTo: "mw://signin/github" /* "mw://signin/google" */,
  },
});

if (data.url) {
  WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(data.url);
}
```

We are using **expo-web-browser** library to open provider page.

Then at **App.tsx** we are listening to deep link events and update supabase session when **access_token** and **refresh_token** parameters are passed:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  Linking.addEventListener("url", (event) => {
    let urlString = event.url.replace("#", "?");
    const url = new URL(urlString);

    const refreshToken = url.searchParams.get("refresh_token");
    const accessToken = url.searchParams.get("access_token");

    if (accessToken && refreshToken) {
      supabase.auth
        .setSession({
          refresh_token: refreshToken,
          access_token: accessToken,
        })
        .then(() => {
          if (
            url.hostname === "signin" &&
            ["/github", "/google"].includes(url.pathname)
          ) {
            WebBrowser.dismissBrowser();
          }
        })
        .catch((err) => console.log({ err }));
    }
  });
  return () => {
    Linking.removeAllListeners("url");
  };
}, []);
```

In some situation we also close the pending open browser, like for github and google web oauth authentications:

```tsx
WebBrowser.dismissBrowser();
```

## Mobile Application

The **RNMobileAPP** folder is a bare react-native project already configured to support expo modules because some modules were useful to implement some features like web oauth authentication.

This is a simple application with base examples for the following features:

- Sign up email / password;
- Sign in email / password;
- Recover password process;
- Authentication using github provider and google provider (web oauth);
- Update user account;
- Logout;
- Terms and conditions screen (configurable using Back office);
- Privacy policy screen (configurable using Back office);

Being the important code in the following files:

- **App.tsx**: application entry where deep linking listeners are configured, supabase session state is defined, and a minimal stack navigation is configured;
- **screens/Auth/Auth.tsx**: examples with code needed for authentication features mentioned above;
- **screens/Account/Account.tsx**:form example for user to update account information and logout;
- **screens/CustomPage/CustomPage.tsx**: used to fetch a custom page from database and show the corresponding html as native elements, using [react-native-render-html](https://meliorence.github.io/react-native-render-html/) library;
- **screens/TermsAndConditions/TermsAndConditions.tsx**: uses **CustomPage** for Terms and conditions;
- **screens/PrivacyPolicy/PrivacyPolicy.tsx**: uses **CustomPage** for Privacy policy;

No visual details or user experience optimizations were considered and it should be updated from project to project according to requirements.

### Internationalization (i18n)

A table called **mobile_international_messages** was configured to allow you to configure your **i18n** message to be using for **RNMobileApp** project. Check migration at **supabase/migrations/20230920095720_add_mobile_international_messages_table.sql** for more details.

This migration also contains a function called **json_mobile_international_messages_for** that is going to be used has the endpoint for **[i18next-http-backend](https://www.i18next.com/how-to/add-or-load-translations#load-using-a-backend-plugin)** while using **[react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/)**, as you can check on our **i18n** config at **App.tsx**:

```tsx
import { initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";
import Backend from "i18next-http-backend";
import { supabaseProjectURL } from "./lib/supabase.configs";

i18n
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .use(Backend)
  .init({
    backend: {
      loadPath: `${supabaseProjectURL}/rest/v1/rpc/json_mobile_international_messages_for?language={{lng}}&namespace={{ns}}`,
    },

    // To be configured for each project
    lng: "en",
    fallbackLng: "en",

    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },

    react: {
      useSuspense: false,
    },
  });
```

#### Usage Example

```tsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";

function Component() {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{t("namespace:message_key")}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

#### What the benefits of this

- You can update your translations directly on our back office;
- You can let your client/project owner change it directly on our back office as well;
- Messages can be changed without needing a new build and deploy;
- For a developer it is easy to go directly to supabase dashboard and paste the needed json for messages;
- No extra costs;

### Push notifications (OneSignal)

OneSignal is a popular push notification service that allows you to send messages and notifications to users in your React Native mobile application.

The first step is to OneSignal account. You can sign up for a free account at **[OneSignal website.](https://dashboard.onesignal.com/signup)**

After creating your account, you need to create a new application on OneSignal dashboard, you can create a separate application for each platform (Android and iOS) or you can just create one.

### - Platform Specific Configurations:

##### - iOS Configuration

To start the process you need a **p8 Authentication Token** or **p12 Push Notification Certificate**.

If you don't have neither a **p8** or **p12** you can create one on **[Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account)** but you need an account with admin rights.

- Option 1: **p8 Authentication Token**

At the moment apple only allows you to have two **p8 tokens**. If you already have two tokens, creating a new one will replace one of tokens you already have.

To see your existing **p8 tokens** you need to go to **Certificates, IDs & Profiles** and select **Keys** or you can just [click here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list).

When creating a new **Token** make sure you select **Apple Push Notifications service (APNs)**.

Once you have your token, just upload it to OneSignal.Get your OneSignal App ID and add it to your App.

- Option 2: **p12 Push Notification Certificate**

To create a **p12 Push Notification Certificate** you need to open **Keychain Access**, on the mac top bar click on
**Keychain Access** -> **Certificate Assistant** -> **Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority**.

Fill the required information and save the certificate on your disk.

Go to **[Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle)** on **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles** select **Identifiers** and select your Identifier, scroll down untill you see **Push Notifications** make sure is selected but do not click **Configure**.

Go back to the **Certificates** menu and add a new one, under **Services**, select **Apple Push Notification service SSL (Sandbox & Production)** and click **Continue**. Select your application and upload the certificate you created on the previous step.

Now download the **.cer certificate**, double click on it and add it to your **Login Keychain**. On your **Keychain** select the certificate and export it. After exporting the certificate go back to OneSignal dashboard and upload it.
Get your OneSignal App ID and add it to your App.

#### - Android Configuration

To start the process you need to create a **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) credentials**. You can obtain these credentials by opening **[Firebase Console](https://firebase.google.com)**. Create a new project or select an existing one and add a new Android app. Follow the setup instructions and download the **google-services.json** file.

Once you have your **google-services.json** file, just upload it to OneSignal.
Get your OneSignal App ID and add it to your App.

### Local development

Go to **RNMobileApp** project and execute

```sh
yarn start
```

Or follow instructions at **RNMobileApp/README.md**.

## Back office - Single Page Application (Web)

For the Back office we are using **ReactJs** with **Vite** bundler.

To help us build this back office we use **[react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/)** library, trying to make it an auto generated back office from our postgres database with some configurations possible to be done using json.

For more advanced configurations **[react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/documentation.html)** documentation should be followed and according code implemented.

Being the important code in the following folders and files:

- **App.tsx**: application entry where back office is configured with information fetched about database schema. Beside that, other routes are defined here for recover password process;
- **components folder**: base components to generate inputs, fields, forms, lists and others to back office;
- **configs folder**: where override configurations are done (explained below);
- **pages/ForgotPasswordForm/ForgotPasswordForm.tsx**: component for page with form used to recover password;
- **pages/UpdatePasswordForm/UpdatePasswordForm.tsx**: component for page with form used to update password;

### Back office configurations

At **configs/configs.ts** we can defined some overrides to our back office.

Here we have an example that defines some **columns** to not be presented for all tables/resources, as well as some input types (**"none"** is used for us to be able to not show some **columns** for specific resources as you can find in the example for **slug** at **custom_pages** table while in **edit** mode).

You can also find the **rich_text** type being used for **content** column at **custom_pages**. With that we are telling that we want to replace the regular text field with a rich text editor. For that we use **[ra-input-rich-text](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/RichTextInput.html)** library.

Another custom type is **select** being used in the example to define a select for **roles**, in regard to **profiles** table, making it possible for an ADMIN user to edit the roles for another user.

```tsx
import { AdminOverrides, InputType, ViewMode } from "../types";

/* To be customizable for each project: by default only ADMIN role exist and no roles using empty array: [], the default for new users */
export const rolesOptions = [{ id: "ADMIN", name: "Admin" }];

const overrideConfigs: AdminOverrides = {
  general: {
    tablesToExclude: [],
    columnsToExclude: ["id", "created_at", "updated_at"],
    inputTypesToExclude: ["jsonb", "none"],
  },
  resources: {
    profiles: {
      create: null,
      edit: {
        roles: {
          type: "select",
          options: rolesOptions,
        },
      },
    },
    custom_pages: {
      edit: {
        content: {
          type: "rich_text",
        },
        slug: {
          type: "none",
        },
      },
      create: {
        content: {
          type: "rich_text",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Internationalization (i18n)

A table called **mobile_international_messages** was configured to allow you to configure your **i18n** message to be using for **RNMobileApp** project. Check migration at **supabase/migrations/20230920095720_add_mobile_international_messages_table.sql** for more details.

To edit json properties with **react-admin** we are using **[react-admin-json-view](https://github.com/MrHertal/react-admin-json-view)** library.

### Feature flags

A table called **feature_flags** was configured to allow you to configure your feature flags while implementing a feature that you need to be hidden while not fully implemented, allowing the team follow continuous integration best practices.

To create a new feature flags you just need to go to backoffice web apps of your project, in staging and production.

### Local development

Go to **BackofficeCMS** project and execute

```sh
yarn dev
```

And open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### Monitoring

To be always up to date on possible crashes and errors of our apps we have decided to use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome) for that.

Each project will need to configure its own Sentry projects, but using a company account is recommended.

### Infrastructure

To have our applications working, as expected, there is a big infrastructure behind it that needs to be configured.

Next we have list of components that needs to be configured. After that some environment variables needed to be configured on your bitbucket repository, for pipelines to work well. This will be mentioned in detail at **Pipelines** section.

#### Supabase

Create two projects:

- staging;
- production;

#### Vercel

Create two projects:

- staging;
- production;

#### Sentry

Create two projects:

- backoffice;
- react-native app;

Create two projects:

- staging (android-staging, android-preview, ios-staging, ios-preview);
- ios-production (android-production, ios-production);

**Note:** Ideally, in future, this process will be automatized.

### Pipelines

In this section the core of pipelines will described in detail. This section will uncover the main benefits of using pipelines.

This repository was configured to have two different pipelines:

- main: triggered when code is pushed to main;
- pull-requests: triggered when a new pull request is created;

Next we explain the flow for each pipeline.

#### Main pipeline

Sequential flow:

- Testing phase (steps run in parallel):

  - Linting backoffice (check code with eslint for backoffice web app);
  - Type check backoffice (check code types with typescript for backoffice web app);
  - Linting react native app (check code with eslint for react native app);
  - Type check react native app (check code types with typescript for react native app);

- Deployment phase for staging environment (steps run in parallel):

  - push database changes on supabase project to staging (**supabase-staging** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of backoffice web app to staging (**backoffice-staging** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of android app to staging using App Center (**android-staging** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of ios app to staging using TestFlight (**ios-staging** deployment environment);

- Deployment phase for production environment (steps triggered manually):

  - push database changes on supabase project to production (**supabase-production** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of backoffice web app to production (**backoffice-production** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of android app to production using App Center (**android-production** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of ios app to production using TestFlight (**ios-production** deployment environment);

  **Note:** On production the deployments were configured to be triggered manually, on bitbucket, to allow the team to decide when it is best to deploy a new release.

#### Pull-requests pipelines

Sequential flow to generate **review apps** about new pull request:

- Testing phase (steps run in parallel):

  - Linting backoffice (check code with eslint for backoffice web app);
  - Type check backoffice (check code types with typescript for backoffice web app);
  - Linting react native app (check code with eslint for react native app);
  - Type check react native app (check code types with typescript for react native app);

- Deployment phase for staging environment (steps run in parallel):

  - build and deployment of backoffice web app as a **review app**: review app link can be taken from pipeline logs, about last script, in regard to **Deployment of Backoffice web app to preview** step (**backoffice-staging** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of android app as a **review app** using App Center (**android-preview** deployment environment);
  - build and deployment of ios app as a **review app** using TestFlight (**ios-preview** deployment environment);

  **Note:** Deployments about react native application were configured to be triggered manually to save pipeline minutes, however, the team can decide to make it automatic by removing `trigger: manual` line. **Review apps** use staging infrastructure.

#### Continuous integration

In software engineering, continuous integration is the practice of merging all developersâ€™ working copies to shared mainline several times a day. That means continuous integration (CI) is an integration of all or several parts of iterative development into a pipeline process and can be automated with CI software (source: Wikipedia).

##### Feature flags

For continuous integration to work smoothly feature flag is a very important feature. Feature flagging allows companies to continuously deliver and deploy software to their users in a faster way. The use of feature flags allows companies to perform gradual feature rollouts, fix bugs in the code without redeploying, experience a more streamlined development cycle and do rollbacks of code more easily.

### Deployment

The pipelines implemented here, assume two environments:

- staging: used for testing new features (in main branch), used for **review apps** (in pull request) and in general for developers implement new features when not using a local environment (not always possible). This environment can also be used for Quality Assurance;
- production: final environment for product being implemented, used by final users;

The term **review apps** will be used here to identify the deliverable generated by pipelines for a pull request. For example:

- Web app, for backoffice, deployed on vercel for a specific pull request;
- Android app uploaded on App Center or Google Play Internal App Sharing;
- iOS app uploaded to Test Flight;

#### Deployment environments

To accomplish the flow for each pipeline described before we need to have the following deployment environments that need to be configured on your bitbucket repository at "Deployments" option ("your-repository-path/deployments"):

##### Staging

- supabase-staging;
- backoffice-staging;
- android-staging;
- ios-staging;
- android-preview;
- ios-preview;

##### Production

- supabase-production;
- backoffice-production;
- android-production;
- ios-production;

#### Environment variables

**Repository level** (needs to be configured on on your bitbucket repository at "Repository variables" option "your-repository-path/admin/pipelines/deployment-settings"):
